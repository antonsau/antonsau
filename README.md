### Hi all ğŸ‘‹

Few years I devoted to development of RPA projects :bulb: for audit and tax professionals. Now I'm researching decentralized finance space :globe_with_meridians: (simultaneously building tools for my team and developing smart contracts). 

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently building a team of analysts in decentralized finance
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning smart contract development in Solidity (Ethereum blockchain)
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on 
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about RPA, intelligent automation, blockchain and its application in finance (smart contracts)
