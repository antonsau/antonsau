### Hi all ðŸ‘‹

Few years I devoted to development of RPA projects :bulb: for audit and tax professionals. Now I'm researching decentralized finance space :satellite: (simultaneously building tools for my team and developing smart contracts). 

- :office: Iâ€™m running a team of analysts in decentralized finance
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning smart contract development in Solidity
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on fintech projects
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about RPA, intelligent automation, blockchain and its application in finance (smart contracts)
